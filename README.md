### About

> I started developing DenBot in October 2022, mainly as a joke between my friends and me. It has since grown into a project that I am quite passionate about.<br /><br /> Some things DenBot can do:
> - Fixes Twitter/X embed links (Discord struggles with image/video embeds when linked in a chat channel)
> - Basic moderation commands
> - Basic general commands (remind me notifications, timer, member lists)
> - YouTube features
> - Music Player
> - Memes (random cat images, pinging friends)
